# Koop BigQuery Provider

This provider uses a service account for BigQuery authentication. Place your service account JSON file in the "gcloud" directory and update the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS in `src/model.js`.

In order to work with BigQuery, you should address the prerequisites listed in the "Before You Begin" section [here](https://github.com/googleapis/nodejs-bigquery#quickstart).


Documentation updates coming soon.
